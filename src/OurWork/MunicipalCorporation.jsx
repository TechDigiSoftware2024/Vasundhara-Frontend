              Smile Foundation through its Livelihood programme connects the
              unemployed or underemployed youth from disadvantaged groups and
              communities with the sectors which have large growth potential in
              terms of revenue generation and employability. The staggering
              youth population underutilised in the job market because of a lack
              of requisite qualifications and training are upskilled, uplifted,
              and mainstreamed to become a part of the country’s growth story.
              The livelihood programme aims to complement the government’s
              vision and efforts under the Skill India mission, and is aligned
              with the Sustainable Development Goals 4 and 8.

            The most effective way to combat world hunger is not merely through
            the distribution of food packs, which offer only short-term relief,
            but through investing in sustainable farming in regions lacking the
            resources to implement it themselves. Many countries in Africa and
            Asia suffer from widespread poverty, leaving them without the funds
            needed to build a strong agricultural sector. Local communities
            working these farms are often no better off—only able to grow just
            enough food to barely survive.

            We have already made a difference in the lives of millions, but it
            is still not enough. Global conflicts, economic recessions, and
            unprecedented shifts on the world stage mean that hunger continues
            to rise despite our efforts. As a result, the need for volunteers
            and donations has never been greater. With your generously donated
            time and money, we are able to train volunteers, distribute food
            packs, provide agricultural kits, and establish modern, high-tech
            farms in the regions that need them most.
